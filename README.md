## Overview :
This dashboard is my insights for three regoinal manager of chain coffee shope with threee stores. The insights presented aim to support data-driven decisions to optimize store operations and enhance profitability.
## Insights :
 - Revenue has shown consistent growth over the months, reflecting strong performance and increasing customers.
 - Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays are the busiest days across all stores. This aligns with workdays when customers prefer coffee to energize themselves for work.
 - Morning hours, particularly around 10 AM, see the highest activity, consistent with customers grabbing coffee while commuting or starting their day.
 - Coffee is the most popular category, with Barista Espresso leading in both sales and profitability across all stores. 
## Data Story :
I have noticed that at the Hell's Kitchen store, sales of merchandise clothing are particularly low, suggesting a lack of demand in this location.We recommend introducing promotional discounts to stimulate customer interest and increase sales or else discontinuing in-store display of these items and making them available only on order. We shall allocate additional staff and ensure sufficient inventory during peak days Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays and hour 10 AM to meet customer demand effectively
